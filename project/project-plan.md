# Project Plan
## Title
The effects of Conventional Energy(Fossil fuels) to environments.

## Main Question
How much the emission of the Conventional energy and it is possible to replace Conventional Energy by Renewable Energy?
## Description

Renewable energy is a buzzword nowadays. It is environment friendly, generating electricity wiht free carbon footprints, i.e. particularly for solar and wind power. On the other hand, conventional energy contributes the most of the share of emission(CO2, SO2, NOx,etc) in the atmosphere. In this project we will find the measurement of carbon footprints of Conventional energy in US and compare the total consumption of renewable and conventional enregy and look for a answer whether it is possible to transform US power generation completely on Renewable Energy. We use two different datasets of US to find our findings. 

Datasources

Datasource1: 
Metadata URL: https://www.eia.gov/renewable/data.php

Data URL: https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/browser/xls.php?tbl=T01.03&freq=m

Data Type: XLS

Short description of the datasource: 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is the statistical and analytical agency within the U.S. Department of Energy.EIA conducts a comprehensive data collection program that covers the full spectrum of energy sources, end uses, and energy flows. EIA also prepares informative energy analyses, monthly short-term forecasts of energy market trends, and long-term U.S. and international energy outlooks. EIA disseminates its data, analyses, and other products primarily through its website, EIA.gov.

Metadata URL: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/hourly-energy-emission-factors-for-electricity-generation-in-the-united-states-00ec8

Data URL: https://data.openei.org/files/276/usmonthlyaveragehourlyemissionfactorsforaznmegridsubregion.csv

Data Type: CSV

Short description of the DataSource :

Monthly average hourly CO2, NOx, and SO2 emission factors for each U.S. eGRID subregion. This project utilized GridViewTM, an electric grid dispatch software package, to estimate hourly emission factors for all of the eGRID subregions in the continental United States. Emission types accounted for included carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2).Data reported as part of this project include hourly average, minimum, and maximum emission factors by month; that is, the average, minimum, and maximum emission factor for the same hour of each day in a month. 

Problem:
1. The Columns has the same name under CO2, SO2 and NOx.
